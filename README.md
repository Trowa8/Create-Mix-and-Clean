__This is an add-on for Create! It won't work without it!__

# <h2>About</h2>
This mod adds mostly new recipes that allow for ore refining, allowing you to get up to 3 times the original amount of ore. Right now it supports 4 types of ore: Iron, Gold, Copper and Zinc but I am planning to add all the other Create-supported ores. 

Newly added spout recipes allow for the removal of dye from Concrete and Concrete Powder, as well as for deoxidizing copper using Hydrochloric Acid.

# <h3>New Fluids</h3>
There are 3 new fluids added by this mod, all with different properties.

1. Hydrochloric Acid - a corrosive liquid that is used to remove rust and dyes from concrete. Has a Yellowish tint. Make sure to not touch it!
2. Chlorine Gas - a gas that is used to create Hydrochloric Acid. Has a Yellow color and likes to cover a lot of space.
3. Hydrogen Gas - a gas that is used to create Hydrochloric Acid. Almost Transparent and easy to walk through.
 

# <h3>Items</h3>
Adds 17 items, 12 of which are for ore refining variants and 3 are buckets for the fluids.

Waste Rock - Byproduct of refining. Can be used to get Stone and a small chance to get a Nugget.

Caustic Soda - an item comprised of a bunch of pebble-like crystals. VERY TOXIC, DO NOT CONSUME!

# <h3>Recipes</h3>
Adds 40 new recipes: 11 Mixer recipes, 4 Compacting recipes, 5 Washing recipes, 12 Spout recipes and other.
