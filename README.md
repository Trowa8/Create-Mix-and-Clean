# About
This mod adds mostly new recipes that allow for ore refining, allowing you to get up to 3 times the original amount of ore.

Right now it supports these types of ore:

**Vanilla+Create**: Iron, Gold, Copper and Zinc, also Ancient Debris.

**Mekanism**: Lead, Osmium, Tin and Uranium. 

**Tinkers Construct**: Cobalt.

**Immersive Engineering**: Lead, Aluminum, Silver, Nickel and Uranium.

> And with time I will try adding all the other Create-supported ores.

Newly added spout recipes allow for the removal of dye from Concrete and Concrete Powder, as well as for deoxidizing copper using Hydrochloric Acid.

## New Fluids
There are 3 new fluids added by this mod, all with different properties.

1. Hydrochloric Acid - a corrosive liquid that is used to remove rust and dyes from concrete. Has a Yellowish tint. Make sure to not touch it!
2. Chlorine Gas - a gas that is used to create Hydrochloric Acid. Has a Yellow color and likes to cover a lot of space.
3. Hydrogen Gas - a gas that is used to create Hydrochloric Acid. Almost Transparent and easy to walk through.
 

## Items
Adds 30+ items, most of which are ore refining variants. Here are some interesting ones:

Waste Rock - Byproduct of refining. Can be used to get Stone and a small chance to get a Nugget.

Caustic Soda - an item comprised of a bunch of pebble-like crystals that can be used to create paper. VERY TOXIC, DO NOT CONSUME!

Crushed Raw Cobalt - newly added support for any cobalt ore to be crushed into crushed cobalt.

## Recipes
Adds 50+ new recipes, including mixer recipes, Spout recipes, and other.
